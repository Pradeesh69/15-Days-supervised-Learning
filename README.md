# 15-Day Supervised Learning Challenge

Welcome to my *15-Day Supervised Learning Challenge* repository! ðŸŽ¯

In this challenge, Iâ€™m working on one supervised learning project each day, covering both regression and classification tasks. The goal is to strengthen my machine learning skills, explore various datasets, and apply a wide range of algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost, NumPy
- *Tools*: Jupyter Notebook

## Goals of the Challenge

- Deepen my understanding of supervised learning algorithms.
- Practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Share progress daily on LinkedIn and update code on GitHub.

## How to Use This Repository

Each project has its own folder, where you can find:
- *Code*: Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts used for the project.
- *Data*: Link to the dataset or instructions on where to find it.

Feel free to explore the projects, try them out, or suggest improvements!
