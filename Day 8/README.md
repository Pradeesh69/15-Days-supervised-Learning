## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) using logistic regression. The model utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization and applies logistic regression for classification. The project covers data cleaning, text preprocessing, and model evaluation to achieve a high-performance spam detection system.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains email data labeled as either spam or ham.

### Features:

- **text**: The email's textual content.
- **spam**: The target variable, indicating whether the email is spam (1) or ham (0).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and check for missing values and duplicates.
   - Remove duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
   - Apply basic text cleaning, such as removing the 'Subject:' prefix from the email content.
   - Balance the dataset by undersampling the majority class (ham) to match the number of spam emails.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Use TF-IDF vectorization to transform the textual content into numerical features for modeling.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model on the test data using a confusion matrix and classification report, including metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the distribution of spam vs. ham emails before and after undersampling.
   - Visualize the confusion matrix to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

## Results

### Model Performance:
- **Precision**: 0.98
- **Recall**: 0.98
- **F1-Score**: 0.98
- **Accuracy**: 0.98

The logistic regression model demonstrates strong performance, with high accuracy and balanced precision and recall scores, making it highly effective at distinguishing between spam and ham emails.
